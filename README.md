# PhysicsEngine & SFML

This project will be my attemp of creating a 2D physics engine written in C++ and based on the video "[Designing a Physics Engine in 5 minutes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_IspRG548E)".

SFML ([Simple and Fast Multimedia Library](https://www.sfml-dev.org/index.php)) will be used to render the windows seen and the objects.
